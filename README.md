Mental health is a crucial component of overall health and well-being, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social aspects. 
It significantly influences individuals' thoughts, feelings, and actions, playing a vital role in their capacity to cope with stress, foster relationships, and make decisions. 
Regrettably, mental health disorders are widespread and can result in severe consequences such as disability, social isolation, and, in extreme cases, suicide.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on mental health, exacerbating pre-existing mental health conditions and giving rise to new ones. This paper aims to explore the current state of knowledge on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, with a particular focus on the ways in which social isolation, economic instability, and increased rates of domestic violence and child abuse have affected mental well-being.
To better understand these issues, the paper will delve into the psychological effects of the pandemic by comparing and analyzing the levels of stress experienced by people of different age groups and from various U.S. states as the Covid pandemic progressed from 2020 to 2021. In doing so, we will examine how the pandemic contributes to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, we will analyze the role of economic instability during the pandemic, which has caused job loss, financial strain, and social instability, all of which contribute to deteriorating mental health.
